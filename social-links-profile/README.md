## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

#### Centering Elements

For the card, I struggled a little bit with the responsiveness, such as setting the margin of the card, to make the card centered on the page. From the previous challenge, I learned that I can use `min-height: 100vh` to make the page full height, and then use `display: flex` and `justify-content: center` to center the content.

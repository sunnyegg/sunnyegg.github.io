# About Me

I'm a backend developer, currently learning frontend development. Expect to see not-so-clever solutions to the challenges. :D

# Frontend Mentor Solutions

This repository contains solutions for Frontend Mentor challenges. There will be a separate folder for each challenge, and each folder will contain a README.md file with a description of the challenge and my solution.
